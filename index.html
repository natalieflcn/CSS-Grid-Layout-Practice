                Sebastian is a big chicken. His family is only pollos.

                tonight, he ate his family!

                Sebastian always wants to play Roblox. He eats Roblox,
                he breathes Roblox, he sleeps Roblox. He plays Roblox so 
                much that he forgets to brush his teeth and take a shower.
                That's why he's so stinky.

                Sebastian hasn't done his homework yet. He could do 
                his homework is Papa's job but instead, he plays Roblox
                all day. Then when he comes home, he plays Roblox all night.
                And then, he only does his homework when his Mom comes home.
                Too bad for him.
                <br><br>
                Sometimes Sebastian likes to do other things too. He used
                to make animation of numbers and watch a lot of YouTube videos.
                Sometimes he'll dance with his sister but she has to force him.
                But now all he does is sit around and be stinky and play Roblox. 
                I can smell him from my room.
